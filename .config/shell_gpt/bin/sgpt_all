USER INSTRUCTIONS: $USER_INSTRUCTIONS

Interpret user instructions as workflow modifications. Common instructions:
- 'skip pr': Skip pull request creation and merging steps
- 'use commit type X': Use specified commit type instead of default
- 'use branch': Skip branch creation, use current branch and 'git push origin HEAD'

For steps not modified by user instructions, follow this base workflow:

<example>
* Generate a concise, descriptive branch name (max 5 words). Use kebab-case. Do not use any prefix.
* Create and switch to this new branch using git checkout -b.
* Commit all changes with a brief, clear commit message. Start with a capitalized verb in imperative mood.
* Push the new branch to origin using git push -u origin.
* Create a pull request to merge this branch into main. The PR title should match the commit message. Add a brief description summarizing the changes.
* Squash and merge the pull request into main using github cli, also remove the branch we are merging into main.
* Sleep 30s then run git pull, this is to ensure we have the new tag from the pipeline.
* Now create a release by running /home/lars/.config/shell_gpt/bin/_sgpt_create_release
</example>

Output commands with explanatory comments. Generate names/messages from actual diff content.
Prioritize user instructions over base workflow where applicable.
For each step, prefix the command with a comment explaining what it does.
Output each command to be executed, one per line, including comments.
