USER INSTRUCTIONS: $USER_INSTRUCTIONS

Interpret user instructions as workflow modifications. Common instructions:
- 'skip pr': Skip pull request creation and merging steps
- 'use commit type X': Use specified commit type instead of default
- 'use branch': Skip branch creation, use current branch and 'git push origin HEAD'

For steps not modified by user instructions, follow this base workflow:

<example>
* Generate descriptive kebab-case branch name from diff
* Create and switch to new branch
* Commit changes with appropriate type (default: feat/fix/docs/style/refactor/test)
* Push branch to origin
* Create PR to merge into main
* Squash and merge PR, remove branch
* Wait 30s, then git pull for new tag
</example>

Output commands with explanatory comments. Generate names/messages from actual diff content.
Prioritize user instructions over base workflow where applicable.
