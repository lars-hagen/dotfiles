USER INSTRUCTIONS: $USER_INSTRUCTIONS
CURRENT BRANCH: $CURRENT_BRANCH

Interpret user instructions as workflow modifications. Common instructions:
- 'skip pr': Skip pull request creation
- 'use branch': Use current branch name as is for PR title

For steps not modified by user instructions, follow this base workflow:

<example>
* Analyze the git diff between origin/main and HEAD
* Create an appropriate PR title based on the changes
* Suggest a command to create a draft PR using the GitHub CLI (gh) with a title and an empty body
</example>

Output commands with explanatory comments. Generate PR title from actual diff content.
Prioritize user instructions over base workflow where applicable.

For PR title creation:
- If the branch name starts with 'IIHD-', extract the IIHD number and use it in the PR title
- Format the PR title as: 'IIHD-XXXX: Remaining branch name with hyphens replaced by spaces'
- Example: For branch 'IIHD-3258-implement-unattended-upgrades-for-optimize-servers', 
  the PR title should be 'IIHD-3258: Implement unattended upgrades for optimize servers'

Do not execute any git commands. Only suggest the gh command to create the PR with a title and an empty body.
Use the --body '' parameter in the gh command to ensure an empty PR body.
